> Software should make life easier. This is why I've switched to Zola.

# Then
In 2020 I was learning more about practical deep learning through [Fast.ai's course](https://course.fast.ai/) and setting up a blog to share my new technical experiences seemed a great idea.
I enjoy learning about pretty much anything but technology always called me. 
Maybe it was because I was exposed quite early by the early 2000s standards, maybe it was because technology seemed to make more sense than people.  

*Anyhow I failed miserably at blogging*.  
Turns out that when I started that blog I was about to learn a big lesson: I'm human and I've got a limited amount of the precious resource that is time, so I should spend it wisely.

To try extending this resource I've decided to invest some of it in my future.
I started to look after my health more.  
Rather than writing, I got back in shape and I [learned to read books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book).
I also learned and achieved a lot but details will be part of other posts, I hope, now back to software.

# Now
I've been using Python almost every day for shy of 3 years now.  
I kind of hate it. To point out exactly **why** I'd say **typing and dependencies**.

I miss Java because I could find out how to integrate code from other people just by reading the API documentation.  
The compiler was the wise friend warning me about unhandled exceptions and telling me if I needed to provide some Interface.  
With Python, I keep needing to look at function implementation or getting brutalized by some bullshit assert that was not expressed in typing and/or docs.  
The debugger was the hip friend that was there when someone fucked around with type erasure and the issue tracker found out.  
With Python the only sane way of actually checking if the interfaces work the way you read they should is execution. And can that take its sweet sweet time?

I miss Dart mainly because of [pub](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd) and its build system.  
Having a single [website](https://pub.dev/) to search for contributed packages, reading if I could use them on my target platforms and knowing that I could just add them to my project was great.  
With Python, everything "works" by virtue of tears and hours wasted looking for GitHub issues and StackOverflow questions.
I never found myself thinking "Can't I just re-implement this?" because I really wanted to solve a problem today rather than dealing with the aftermath of adding this battle-tested dependency to my `pyproject.toml` / `Pipenv` / `requirements.txt` / `environment.yml`.
