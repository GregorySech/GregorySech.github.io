I'm Gregory Sech and I'm a Computer Scientist. I like to listen to people's 
problems and sometimes I wonder how much technology solved or made things worse.  

This website is meant to be a repository of what I do and what I think. 
I hope it can showcase my thought process and how I approach making solutions.
